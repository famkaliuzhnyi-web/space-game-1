## Executive Summary

**Title:** Space Logistics RPG  
**Genre:** 2D Space RPG with Logistics Simulation

### Core Concept
Play as a single character in a living galaxy, piloting various ships to deliver cargo between stations and planets. The game focuses on supply chain management, economic simulation, and character progression through a complex web of faction relationships and dynamic events.

## Game Vision

5. **Upgrade & Expand:** Use earnings to improve ships, equipment, or buy new vessels

### Core Pillars

#### 1. Logistics Mastery
- **Supply Chain Management:** Understand complex production chains
- **Route Optimization:** Find efficient paths through dangerous or monitored space
- **Cargo Specialization:** Different goods require different ship configurations
- **Time Pressure:** Some deliveries are time-sensitive with bonus/penalty systems

#### 2. Economic Simulation
- **Living Economy:** Stations consume and produce goods based on their type

- **Security Dynamics:** Different regions have varying law enforcement

## Game Mechanics

### Time System
- **Time Standard:** All in-game time references use Earth standards (Earth Day, Earth Hour, etc.)
- **Time Flow:** Real-time progression with time acceleration options
- **Day/Night Cycle:** 24 Earth Hour cycles affect station operations and NPC availability
- **Mission Timing:** Time-sensitive deliveries measured in Earth Days/Hours
- **Production Cycles:** Station manufacturing follows Earth Day schedules

### Character System
- **Single Persistent Character:** One player character throughout the game
- **Skill Progression:** Experience-based improvement in various areas
- **Faction Standing:** Reputation with different groups affects available missions
- **Personal Equipment:** Tools for hacking, self-defense, and exploration

### Ship Management
- **Multi-Ship Ownership:** Own and store multiple ships at stations
- **Hub-Based Construction:** Build ships from modular "hubs" with equipment slots
- **Interior Functionality:** Hubs provide interior spaces for crew movement and repair work
- **Specialization:** Different hub configurations optimized for different cargo types
- **Manual Maintenance:** Player can walk through ship interior to repair specific broken modules using tools

### Economic Gameplay
- **Contract System:** Mission board with various delivery types
- **Market Trading:** Buy low, sell high with real-time price fluctuations
- **Speculation:** Invest in goods before price changes
- **Information Trading:** Buy and sell market data

### Exploration & Events
- **Sector Navigation:** Move between connected star systems
- **Random Encounters:** Pirates, merchants, derelicts, and anomalies
- **Station Events:** Social interactions, missions, and story beats
- **Discovery System:** Find new routes, resources, and opportunities

### Weapons and Defense Systems
- **Kinetic Weapons Only:** All weapons use kinetic projectiles, no energy weapons
- **Magnetic Shields:** Larger ships can mount magnetic shields that deflect kinetic projectiles
- **Shield Mechanics:** Magnetic shields have limited health pool and can be overwhelmed
- **No Shields for Small Ships:** Smallest ship classes rely only on hull armor
- **Missile Systems:** Guided explosive projectiles for heavier combat

### Security and Licensing
- **Sector Restrictions:** Some high-security sectors forbid weapons entirely
- **Weapon Licenses:** Extremely expensive permits allow armed ships in restricted space
- **Law Enforcement:** Security forces respond to illegal weapons in protected zones
- **Pacifist Gameplay:** Game design encourages avoiding combat through economics

### Universe Reset Feature
- **Save File Transfer:** Start new universe with existing character progression
- **Selective Transfer:** Choose which elements to carry over (location, relations, etc.)
- **New Game Plus:** Retain character skills and relationships in fresh economy
- **Problem Recovery:** Reset universe state while preserving character investment

## Target Experience

### Session Length
- **Short Sessions (15-30 min):** Complete single deliveries or manage inventory
- **Medium Sessions (1-2 hours):** Multi-stop routes or faction missions
- **Long Sessions (3+ hours):** Major storylines or economic manipulation

### Emotional Journey

- **Mid Game:** Mastery and optimization as you build trade routes
- **Late Game:** Complex faction relationships and major economic storylines

### Player Rewards
- **Financial Success:** Growing wealth and trading expertise
