## Lore and Background

### Corporate History
Founded by environmental scientists concerned about humanity's impact on natural ecosystems, Botanica Corporation developed from a grassroots movement into a major force in sustainable agriculture and terraforming. Their breakthrough came with the development of adaptive plant genetics that could thrive in alien environments.

Botanica's reputation was established during the successful terraforming of New Eden, where their ecosystem engineering created the first self-sustaining biosphere on a previously barren world. This achievement proved that natural solutions could be more effective than purely technological approaches.

### Corporate Philosophy
"Natural harmony, galactic growth" - Botanica believes that sustainable development and environmental stewardship are essential for humanity's long-term survival. They advocate for working with natural systems rather than against them, creating solutions that benefit both human colonies and local ecosystems.

### Specializations
- **Terraforming Technology**: Atmospheric processing using biological systems and engineered organisms
- **Sustainable Agriculture**: Organic farming systems adapted for space colonies and alien worlds
- **Ecosystem Engineering**: Creating balanced biospheres and food webs in artificial environments
- **Plant Genetics**: Developing crops that thrive in extreme conditions while maintaining nutritional value

### Territory and Influence
Botanica operates vast agricultural complexes and research gardens throughout the galaxy. Their terraforming projects span multiple star systems, and their agricultural stations supply fresh, organic food to colonies that can afford premium nutrition. The corporation also maintains seed banks preserving genetic diversity from Earth and discovered alien worlds.

### Faction Relations
- **Allied**: SigmaTower Corporation (collaborative research in biological systems)
- **Partners**: Environmental groups and sustainable development organizations
- **Competitors**: Industrial agriculture corporations and synthetic food manufacturers
- **Advocates for**: Colonial settlers seeking sustainable long-term development

### Notable Achievements
- Successfully terraformed three entire worlds using biological ecosystem engineering
- Developed the "Genesis Protocol" - standard procedures for establishing sustainable biospheres
- Created drought-resistant crops that saved the Proxima Centauri agricultural colonies
- Established the Galactic Seed Preserve, protecting genetic diversity across human space

### Environmental Philosophy
Unlike corporations focused on maximum efficiency, Botanica prioritizes long-term sustainability and environmental health. They refuse contracts that would damage existing ecosystems and often provide pro-bono services to struggling colonies in need of sustainable food systems.

### Corporate Culture
Botanica attracts scientists, farmers, and environmental advocates who share a passion for sustainable development. The corporation operates more like a research cooperative than a traditional business, with employees owning shares and participating in democratic decision-making processes. Their facilities are designed as living ecosystems that demonstrate their environmental principles.

### Research Focus
The corporation maintains extensive research programs in xenobotany, studying plant life on alien worlds to understand how natural ecosystems adapt to different environments. This research often leads to breakthrough applications in terraforming and sustainable agriculture.
