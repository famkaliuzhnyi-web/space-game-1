# Issue #2: Bundle Size Optimization and Performance

## ⚡ Issue Type
**Performance / Optimization**

## 📋 Summary
The production build generates a **711.82 kB JavaScript bundle** that exceeds Vite's 500kB warning threshold. This impacts initial load time and mobile user experience, especially important given the project's mobile-friendly focus.

## 🔍 Details
**Current Build Output:**
```
dist/assets/index-3b4422d4.js   711.82 kB │ gzip: 180.16 kB
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Large bundle size affects first-time load performance
- No code splitting implemented
- All game systems loaded upfront even if not immediately needed
- Potentially inefficient import patterns

**Mobile Impact:**
- Slower loading on mobile devices
- Higher data usage
- Poor experience on slow connections

## 💥 Impact
- **User Experience**: Slow initial loading, especially on mobile
- **SEO**: Poor Core Web Vitals scores
- **Accessibility**: Excludes users on slow connections
- **Mobile Performance**: Contradicts mobile-friendly design goals

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reduce main bundle size to under 500kB
- [ ] Implement code splitting for game systems
- [ ] Lazy load non-critical components
- [ ] Analyze and optimize import patterns
- [ ] Maintain gzip size under 150kB
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for mobile users
- [ ] Add bundle analysis tooling

## 🔧 Suggested Implementation
1. **Code Splitting Strategy:**
   - Split game engine from UI components
   - Lazy load individual game systems (Combat, Hacking, etc.)
   - Route-based splitting for different game screens

2. **Import Optimization:**
   - Use tree shaking effectively
   - Audit large dependencies
   - Consider lighter alternatives for heavy libraries

3. **Progressive Loading:**
   - Load core game first, systems on demand
   - Implement loading states for better UX
   - Add service worker for caching

4. **Bundle Analysis:**
   - Add webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar
   - Set up CI checks for bundle size regression
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

## 📊 Expected Results
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce from 711kB to ~400kB
- **Load Time**: Improve initial load by 40-60%
- **Mobile Score**: Achieve Lighthouse performance score >90

## 📊 Priority
**High** - Critical for mobile user experience
