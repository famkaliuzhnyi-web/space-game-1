# Issue #4: Security Vulnerabilities and Dependency Updates

## 🔒 Issue Type
**Security / Maintenance**

## 📋 Summary
The project has **2 moderate security vulnerabilities** in dependencies and several deprecated packages that need updating. This poses security risks and may affect long-term maintainability.

## 🔍 Details
**Security Issues:**
- `npm audit` reports 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities
- Several deprecated packages in use:
  - `rimraf@3.0.2` (deprecated, memory leaks)
  - `inflight@1.0.6` (deprecated, memory leaks)
  - `glob@7.2.3` (deprecated)
  - `eslint@8.57.1` (no longer supported)

**Dependency Concerns:**
- Using older versions that may have known vulnerabilities
- Deprecated packages no longer receiving security updates
- Potential compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions

## 💥 Impact
- **Security Risk**: Known vulnerabilities in production
- **Compliance**: May fail security audits
- **Maintenance Burden**: Deprecated packages become harder to maintain
- **Future Compatibility**: Risk of breaking changes with Node.js updates

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Resolve all security vulnerabilities (0 high/critical, <2 moderate)
- [ ] Update all deprecated dependencies to supported versions
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for automatic dependency updates
- [ ] Document security update process
- [ ] Add security policy and reporting mechanism
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are actively maintained

## 🔧 Suggested Implementation

### 1. Immediate Security Fixes
```bash
# Audit and fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
npm audit fix --force  # If breaking changes are acceptable

# Update deprecated packages
npm update eslint@latest
npm install rimraf@latest
npm install glob@latest
```

### 2. Dependency Management Strategy
- **Update Schedule**: Monthly security updates, quarterly major updates
- **Testing**: Automated testing after dependency updates
- **Monitoring**: Set up GitHub security alerts
- **Documentation**: Track security-related changes

### 3. CI/CD Security Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Action
name: Security Audit
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm audit --audit-level moderate
      - run: npm outdated
```

### 4. Proactive Security Measures
- **Dependabot Configuration**: Auto-create PRs for security updates
- **SECURITY.md**: Add security reporting guidelines
- **License Compliance**: Audit for license compatibility
- **Supply Chain**: Verify package integrity

## 🚨 Security Best Practices
- Regular dependency audits (weekly)
- Pin dependency versions in package-lock.json
- Use `npm ci` in production builds
- Monitor security advisories for used packages
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## 📊 Expected Results
- **Zero Critical/High** security vulnerabilities
- **<2 Moderate** vulnerabilities (acceptable threshold)
- **100% Supported** dependencies (no deprecated packages)
- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot managing security patches

## 📊 Priority
**High** - Security issues should be addressed promptly
