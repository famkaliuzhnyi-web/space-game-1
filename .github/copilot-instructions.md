## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap, Build, and Test the Repository
```bash
# Install dependencies - takes ~1 minute
npm install

# Build for production - takes ~3.12 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 60+ seconds.
npm run build

# Run comprehensive test suite - takes ~14.29 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 60+ seconds.
npm run test
# Expected: 713/713 tests pass, 2 AudioContext failures in test environment are normal

# Run development server - starts in ~195ms
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:5173 with hot module replacement
```

### Code Quality and Validation
```bash
# Run ESLint - takes ~few seconds
npm run lint
# Expected: ~159 issues (3 errors, 156 warnings) - mostly TypeScript 'any' warnings, not blocking

# Run tests with UI - for interactive test debugging
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage reports
npm run test:coverage

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Manual Validation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always run through complete user scenarios after making changes. Simply starting/stopping the application is NOT sufficient.

### Essential Validation Scenarios
1. **Character Creation Flow**:
   - Launch game with "ðŸš€ Launch Game" button
   - Skip or complete new player guide
   - Create character: enter name, select background, allocate attributes
   - Verify character creation completes successfully

2. **Basic Game Navigation**:
   - Test main UI navigation buttons (Nav, Market, Contracts, etc.)
   - Verify game canvas renders properly
   - Check that NPCs load (should show "ðŸ‘¥ NPCs (2)" or similar)
   - Test tutorial system functionality

3. **Core Game Systems**:
   - Trading interface and market functionality
   - Character progression and skill systems
   - Quest system and faction interactions
   - Combat and security systems (if modifying related code)

**Always validate that your changes don't break the character creation flow - this is the critical user onboarding experience.**

## System Requirements and Dependencies

### Essential Requirements
- **Node.js**: >=14.18.0 (specified in package.json engines)
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge with Canvas and WebGL support
- **Memory**: Game uses ~50MB for full experience
- **No additional SDK installations required** - all dependencies via npm

### Key Technologies
```json
{
  "frontend": "React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 6",
  "testing": "Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom", 
  "graphics": "HTML5 Canvas + Three.js",
  "state": "Custom Game Engine with Object Pooling",
  "build": "Vite + TypeScript compilation"
}
```

## Timeout Values and Timing Expectations

**CRITICAL**: Set appropriate timeouts for all operations. Do not use default timeouts that may cause premature cancellation.

### Command Timing Guide
- `npm install` - **1 minute. Set timeout: 300+ seconds**
- `npm run build` - **3.12 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout: 60+ seconds**  
- `npm run test` - **14.29 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout: 60+ seconds**
- `npm run dev` - **195ms startup. Set timeout: 30+ seconds**
- `npm run lint` - **Few seconds. Set timeout: 30+ seconds**

**WARNING**: Build and test processes should NEVER be cancelled. Even if they appear to hang, wait at least 60 seconds before considering alternatives.

```

### Important Files and Locations
- **Game Entry**: `/src/main.tsx` -> `/src/App.tsx` -> `/src/GameApp.tsx`
- **Character Creation**: `/src/components/ui/CharacterCreationPanel.tsx`
- **Game Canvas**: `/src/components/game/GameCanvas.tsx`
- **Test Setup**: `/src/test/setup.ts`
- **Build Config**: `vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`
- **Type Configs**: `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `eslint.config.js` - Code quality rules (allows 'any' warnings in legacy code)
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration with chunk optimization
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration with jsdom environment

## Validation and CI Requirements

### Pre-commit Validation
Always run these commands before committing changes:
```bash
npm run lint    # Fix code style issues
npm run test    # Ensure tests pass
npm run build   # Verify build succeeds
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
After making changes, ALWAYS:
1. âœ… Test character creation flow end-to-end
2. âœ… Verify game launches without console errors
3. âœ… Check that UI interactions work properly
4. âœ… Test any specific systems you modified
5. âœ… Take screenshots of UI changes for verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Errors:**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
npm install
npm run build
```

**Test Failures:**
- AudioContext failures in test environment are expected (2 failing tests normal)
- Run specific test: `npm test -- src/test/SystemName.test.ts`
- Use test UI for debugging: `npm run test:ui`

**Development Server Issues:**
- Ensure port 5173 is available
- Check browser console for WebGL/Canvas errors
- Verify no ad blockers interfere with localhost

**TypeScript Issues:**
- Most 'any' type warnings can be ignored (legacy code cleanup in progress)
- Ensure Node.js >=14.18.0 for proper type support
- Check that all `@types/*` dependencies are installed

### Performance Expectations
- **Bundle Size**: ~220KB gzipped main bundle + chunked modules
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB typical, <100MB peak
- **Startup Time**: <1 second to interactive
- **Test Performance**: 713 tests in ~14 seconds

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Game Systems
1. Create system file in `/src/systems/`
2. Add corresponding test file in `/src/test/`
3. Update type definitions in `/src/types/`
4. Always test with full character creation flow

### Modifying UI Components
1. Components are in `/src/components/ui/` or `/src/components/game/`
2. Test changes with actual game interactions
3. Verify responsive behavior across screen sizes
4. Check console for React warnings

### Working with Game Data
- Game content in `/src/data/` directory
- Faction data, equipment, quests, and economic data
- Always validate JSON structure and type compatibility

**Remember: This is a fully functional game, not a template. All systems are interconnected and changes may have cascading effects. Always validate the complete user experience.**
