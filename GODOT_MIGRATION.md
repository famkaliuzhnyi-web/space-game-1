# Godot Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the migration of the Space Game 1 from React/TypeScript/Vite to the Godot engine.

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Setup and Preparation** âœ… 
- [x] Moved original implementation to `orig/` directory
- [x] Created basic Godot project structure  
- [x] Established core engine components
- [x] Documented migration plan

**Phase 2: System Migration** (Planned)
- [ ] Port core game systems to GDScript
- [ ] Migrate game data structures
- [ ] Implement UI system
- [ ] Port game logic and mechanics

**Phase 3: Feature Migration** (Planned) 
- [ ] Migrate all 29 game systems
- [ ] Port character creation and progression
- [ ] Implement combat system
- [ ] Migrate economic simulation
- [ ] Port faction and reputation system

**Phase 4: Testing and Polish** (Planned)
- [ ] Create test framework for Godot
- [ ] Port existing test cases
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile platform support

## Architecture Comparison

### Original (React/TypeScript)
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ engine/          # Core game engine
â”œâ”€â”€ systems/         # 29 game systems
â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # React UI components  
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Game data and assets
â””â”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
```

### Godot Version
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ orig/           # Original implementation preserved
â”œâ”€â”€ scenes/         # Godot scene files
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/        # GDScript files
â”œâ”€â”€ systems/        # Game systems (GDScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/             # UI scenes and scripts
â””â”€â”€ docs/           # Documentation (preserved)

## System Migration Mapping

| Original TypeScript Class | Godot Equivalent | Status |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------|
| Engine.ts | GameEngine.gd | âœ… Stub created |
| SystemManager.ts | GameSystemManager.gd | âœ… Stub created |
| CharacterManager.ts | systems/character/CharacterManager.gd | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| EconomicSystem.ts | systems/economy/EconomicSystem.gd | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| CombatManager.ts | systems/combat/CombatManager.gd | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| WorldManager.ts | systems/world/WorldManager.gd | ðŸ“‹ Planned |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Core Engine Components
- Game loop management
- Input handling  
- Rendering system
- System coordination

### 2. Game Systems (Priority Order)
1. **WorldManager** - Galaxy, sectors, stations
2. **CharacterManager** - Player character and progression
3. **EconomicSystem** - Trading and market simulation
4. **FactionManager** - Reputation and politics
5. **CombatManager** - Ship-to-ship combat
6. **QuestManager** - Missions and storylines
7. **SaveManager** - Game persistence
8. **AchievementManager** - Progress tracking

### 3. UI Migration
- Convert React components to Godot UI scenes
- Maintain existing UX patterns
- Optimize for both desktop and mobile

### 4. Data Migration
- Port JSON data files to Godot resources
- Maintain compatibility with save files
- Preserve game balance and mechanics

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Godot's built-in optimization features
- Native compilation benefits
- Better mobile performance

### Platform Support  
- Native desktop builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Mobile platform optimization (iOS, Android)
- Web export capabilities

### Development Workflow
- Godot editor integration
- Version control considerations
- Asset management

## Preservation of Original

The original React/TypeScript implementation is preserved in the `orig/` directory:
- Complete source code maintained
- Documentation preserved  
- Build system intact
- Tests preserved for reference
- GitHub Pages deployment continues to work

This ensures the existing game remains playable while migration proceeds.

## Next Steps

1. **System-by-System Migration**: Start with core systems
2. **Incremental Testing**: Ensure each system works before proceeding
3. **UI Recreation**: Rebuild interface in Godot UI system
4. **Performance Optimization**: Take advantage of Godot's engine features
5. **Platform Deployment**: Set up builds for multiple platforms

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (core systems)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks (feature migration)  
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks (testing/polish)
- **Total**: 6-9 weeks for full migration

## Resources

- **Original Codebase**: `orig/` directory
- **Godot Documentation**: https://docs.godotengine.org/
- **Migration Progress**: Track in GitHub issues
- **Testing**: Maintain parity with original 628 test cases
